# Netcool Operations Insight event management for Hybrid application

(In Progress....)

IBM Netcool Operations Insight accelerates the operations management lifecycle from problem detection to fix. It receives event from ressource monitoring solutions, enriches, correlates and escalates events based on rule automation.

![System Context Flow](NOI system context flow.png?raw=true)  

In this document you will understand how to setup IBM NetcoolÂ® Operations Insight (NOI) in the middle of the service management tool chain and demonstrate the interaction of NOI with the other tool chain components of the toolchain.

Note: We will not cover standard installation and operation of NOI, since this is not unique to the Bluemix environment, but we will links to references. 
We will also link to the guide [Integrate Netcool Operations Insight into your Bluemix service management tool chain](https://developer.ibm.com/cloudarchitecture/docs/service-management/netcool-operations-insight) for details about the integration with Bluemix.



Netcool Operations Insight is operated though a web based GUI called DASH, login is https://{yourServer}:16311/ibm/console.



##Step 1: Install and Setup IBM Netcool Operations Insight

For base setup of an NOI instance, please follow the information of guide [Integrate Netcool Operations Insight into your Bluemix service management tool chain](https://developer.ibm.com/cloudarchitecture/docs/service-management/netcool-operations-insight)

##Step 2: Enable event reception for NewRelic incident send as webhooks


The integration is based on New Relic's webhook capabilities. The NewRelic events are received by means of the Netcool Omnibus message bus probe. For reading and parsing the NewRelic json format, there are some probe configuration files prepared.

### Message bus probe configuration    

1. Install the message bus probe per the [standard IBM instructions](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSSHTQ/omnibus/probes/message_bus/wip/concept/messbuspr_intro.html) and adjust by any local requirements (mail server considerations, H/A considerations, etc.) 

    Note that the lowest version of the probe that supports New Relic integration is 1.3. For integrating the new Alerts webhooks, you need to use the message bus probe version 1.3.0.5.

    [Learn more about the probe for message bus.](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21970413)

2. Clone git repository.

    `# git clone https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-cloudnative-csmo.git`
    
    `# cd refarch-cloudnative-csmo`

    Since this instance of the message bus probe will only support New Relic events, it is assumed that all 
probe files will have a suffix of _newrelic and that the probe name will be message_bus_newrelic. The 
included configuration files follow this format, but you are free to change them to suit your own local 
standards.

#### Setup of messagebus_newrelic.props:    
1. Copy the included file `scripts/EventMgmt/NOI/probes/arch/message_bus_newrelic.props` to `$OMNIHOME/probes/{arch}/message_bus_newrelic.props` on your probe server. 

    Replace the {arch} with your platform type running the probe. For example `$OMNIHOME/probes/linux2x86/message_bus_newrelic.props`

    Make any necessary changes, such as matching ObjectServer name to your local ObjectServer. 
    
2. Remember to reload the probe rules (or restart the probe) after changing the props files. 
    
#### Setup of htpTransport_newrelic.properties:
1. Copy the included file `scripts/EventMgmt/NOI/java/conf/httpTransport_newrelic.properties` to `$OMNIHOME/java/conf/httpTransport_newrelic.properties` on your probe server.

    Make any necessary changes to the `httpTransport_newrelic.properties` file, such as choosing a suitable 
port and security settings.  
    Since New Relic sends url-encoded data, the line `expectedMIMEType=application/x-www-form-urlencoded` is mandatory. 
    
2. Remember to reload the probe rules (or restart the probe) after changing the properties files.

#### Setup of messagebus_newrelic.rules:    
1. Copy the included file `scripts/EventMgmt/NOI/probes/arch/message_bus_newrelic.rules` to `$OMNIHOME/probes/{arch}/message_bus_newrelic.rules` on your probe server.

    Replace the {arch} with your platform type running the probe. For example `$OMNIHOME/probes/linux2x86/message_bus_newrelic.rules `

    The included rules file is a default set of rules for New Relic integration. You may have to adjust it to suit 
your local standards for rules files. 

2. Remember to reload the probe rules (or restart the probe) after changing the rules files. 


##Step 3: Install and Setup enrichment database 
Incoming events will be enriched with information about the business service and location to allow an easier view on business services likes BlueCompute and the source of the hybrid application. This additional information is important as other tools of the tool chain will need this kind of information for better aligned operation. For example the Runbook automation will need the information about where the component is hosted to use the correct execution trigger for running the runbook.

The enrichment data source has been prepared as a MySQL database, which will be accessed by NOI. Incoming events are retrieved, enriched with the information from the database before escalation and other automations will be triggered.

The database can be exchanged by any other existing configuration data source which provides the same data schema like IBM Control Desk CMDB.
      

1. Install and setup a MySQL enrichment database.

    For detailed steps please continue with [Installing MySQL](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-cloudnative-csmo/blob/master/doc/Dashboarding/Grafana/mysql.md)
    
2. Install and setup the MySQL maintenance PHP UI

    For detailed steps please continue with [Installing PHP](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-cloudnative-csmo/blob/master/doc/Dashboarding/Grafana/php.md)
    
3. Add application instances for your BlueCompute environment into the database

    + Either add them manually via the PHP UI for MySQL:

         i) Connect to the maintenande UI (php) for managing the database content at `http://{your-serrver}/cmdb.php`
        
         ii) Replace the {your-server} with the address of your enrichment database server running the PHP ui.
        
         iii) Use the "Add" button to add new entry
        
         iv) Fill in the form with
         
              - APPID   (an unique ID for this configuration item for internal database use, the NewRelic id for the item can be used for example)
              - APPNAME   (the name of the application component as provided by the monitoring sources like `bluecompute-web-app`)
              - APPTYPE (type of application like `node.js`, `java`, `mysql`,...)
              - REGIONAME (tag for the location like `bmx_eu-gb`, `sl_us`,...)
              - CLIENT (name of client the application belongs to)
              - DESCRIPTION (short description about the application entry, like `bluecompute web application`)
              - SERVICENAME (associated business service name the application component belongs to like `BlueCompute`)
              - SERVICEID (id for the business service, the NewRelic service map id can be used for example)
                
                   
    + or import them with a mysql script:
    
        Use a script similar to the [cmdb.sql script](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-cloudnative-csmo/blob/master/doc/Dashboarding/Grafana/scripts/cmdb.sql) with your custom entries
    
    
##Step 4: Enrich events with enrichment database

The Impact component of NOI will use this enrichment database to enrich incoming events. You need three Impact configurations to achieve this:

+ Impact DataSource `BMXCMDB` accessing the MySQL database 

+ Impact Policy `EnrichEventWithBMXCMDB` to find a match in the database for the node name of an incoming event and updating the fields `Service`,`Location`,`ScopeId` and `CASE_Client` accordingly.

+ Impact Service `CASE_Omnibus_BMX_Enrich` which runs with Netcool Omnibus start, triggering the policy above for each newly reveiced event having set `CASE_BMX_CMDB=1`. For NewRelic events this will be done on the probe level.

The configuration can be imported into your Netcool Impact instance.

1. Copy the included file `scripts/EventMgmt/NOI/impact/case_impact_enrichment_project.tgz` to `/tmp` on your impact server.

2. Extract project on your impact server

    `# cd /tmp`
    
    `# tar xf case_impact_enrichment_project.tgz`

3. Import the CSMO-Enrichment project into your Impact server

    `# $NCHOME/bin/nci_import {server_name} /tmp/case_impact_enrichment_project`
    
     Replace the {server_name} with the name of your Impact server instance.
     
     Example: 
     
     `# /opt/IBM/tivoli/impact/bin/nci_import NCI /tmp/case_impact_enrichment_project`
    
4. Change the connection information of your `BMXCMDB` datasource with your `Username`, `Password`, `Hostname`, `Port` and your desired `Database Failure Policy` via the Impact UI.

    Default is 
    
    + Username=cmdb 
    + Password=cmdb 
    + Hostname=159.8.41.178 
    + Port=3306 
    + Database Failure Policy=Disable Backup


##Step 5: Create View and Filter for BlueCompute

When the events are enriched with the data from the enrichment database, views and filters can be defined to use the enrichment information accordingly.


 
The configuration can be imported into your NOI DASH instance. For additional details refer to the [product information].(https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSSHTQ_8.1.0/com.ibm.netcool_OMNIbus.doc_8.1.0/webtop/wip/task/web_adm_expimpimportdata.html)

1. Copy the included file `scripts/EventMgmt/NOI/webgui/case_webgui_filter_and_views.zip` to `$JazzSM_HOME/ui/input/data.zip` on your NOI DASH server.

    where $JazzSM_HOME is the home directory of your DASH installation, like `/opt/IBM/JazzSM`
    
    Note: If you have changed the `import.importFile` statement in the `$WEBGUI_HOME/integration/importexport_tool/etc/OMNIbusWebGUI_settings.properties` configuration file, move the data.zip accordingly to the specified directory.

2. Import filter and view into your NOI DASH server

    `# cd $JazzSM_HOME/ui/bin`
    
    `# ./consolecli.sh Import --username {smadmin} --password {password} --excludePlugins ImportPagePlugin,ChartImportPlugin --settingFile $WEBGUI_HOME/integration/importexport_tool/etc/OMNIbusWebGUI_settings.properties`

    where $WEBGUI_HOME is the home directory of your WebGui installation, like `/opt/IBM/netcool/gui/omnibus_webgui`, {smadmin} your WebSphere administrative user and {password} the password of this user.
   

##Step 6: View application events for BlueCompute

Upon login you access the list of active events through the Incident -> Event Viewer menu.

The list of events displayed is controlled by a filter. You may, for example, wish to see only events related to a specific application or you may wish to see all the events which occurred in the last 10 minutes.

+ The filter "BlueCompute" displays all events for the BlueCompute business service based on the event field setting "Service=BlueCompute".
 
The format of the list is controlled by the View. 

+ The view "Case_Integrations" displays all events in a grouping form, where the first level is âServiceNameâ and the second level âLocationâ.  
    
These fields have been enriched for each technical event coming from the monitoring sources based on a  configuration data source.

By this you can immediately see all affected services including the BlueCompute application and sub-grouped by location. 
In the following screenshot has two events with application components running on EU Bluemix region (bmx_eu-gb) and on Softlayer (SL).

##Step 7: Forward critical events to alert notification system

Forwarding critical events to the IBM alert Notification System (ANS) is done via the Netcool Impact policies. Alerts will be send with ANS field `ApplicationsOrServices` set to value of NOI field `service`.


You need four Impact configurations to achieve this:

+ Impact DataSource `defaultobjectserver` accessing the Omnibux event database 

+ Impact Policy `SendAlertsToAlertNotification` to send alerst to ANS.

+ Impact Policy `DeleteAlertsFromAlertNotification` to remove alerts from ANS, if event has been cleared.

+ Impact Service `AlertNotificationService` which runs with Netcool Omnibus start, triggering the policies above for each newly reveiced or changed events.
