# Cloud Service Management and Operation for Hybrid application

(In Progress....)

## Architecture Overview
This project provides is a reference implementation for managing a BlueCompute Application that is hybrid in nature.
Cloud based applications need to be available all the time. Proper processes need to be put in place to assure availability and performance. This includes Incident and Problem management to respond to outages, but also Release Management to assure a seamless deployment and release of new versions.

  The Logical Architecture for overall Cloud Service Management and Operations is shown in the picture below.

### Understanding System Context Flows for the Tools in CSMO Toolchain Connecting BlueCompute Application


#### System Context Flow for New Relic

<![System Context Flow NewRelic](static/imgs/???.png?raw=true)>

The above figure shows the deep dive of NewRelic Ressource Monitoring and its various components and various integrated tools for incident management and their interactions. 

1.	NewRelic offers the instrumenation of BlueCompute components like Node.js applications, nginx webserver/loadbalancers, java microservices and mysql databases and allows monitoring of key performance indicators for those ressources. It detects also Bluemix services used by various Bluemix applications. Both Public and SoftLayer instances are monitored. In Bluemix we will find native clound foundry applications as well as docker containers. 

2.	The data will be transferred to NewRelic management system which is accessible with the UI and API calls.

3.	If thresholds are exceeded based on defined alert policy settings one or more alerting channels can be used.

4.	These channels actually forward the incident to external event correlation and/or a Dashboard solutions. In this scenario we are using NOI for event correlation and NewRelic forwards its events to a Netcool Omnibus message bus probe via a WebHook channel. 


<!--- #### System Context Flow for BAM 

![System Context Flow BAM](static/imgs/???.png?raw=true)

The above figure shows the deep dive of IBM Bluemix Application Monitoring (BAM) and its various components and various integrated tools for incident management and their interactions. BAM monitors the status Bluemix application in two ways.

1.	BAM will check base application URLs and also run Rest get/post calls against the BlueCompute Rest APIs.

2.	Secondly we can record synthetic web transaction scripts with the Selennium IDE browser plugin, upload them into BAM and playback those scripts from different data centers around the world.

3.	Both checks will provide status information and response time of the application components and sampled transaction use cases.

4.	Based on threshold settings violations in terms of availability or performance can be reported to the IBM Alert Notification System (ANS) Bluemix Service.

5.	ANS then will also forward these incidents to an external event correlation system via email. In this scenario we are using NOI as event correlation system.

#### System Context Flow for IBM Netcool Operations Insights (NOI)

<![System Context Flow NOI](static/imgs/???.png?raw=true)>

The above figure shows the deep dive of NOI and its various components and various integrated tools for incident management and their interactions. One of the key takeaways from the diagram is that the solution supports a heterogeneous mixture of products and solutions, each feeding or being fed by the central NOI solution.

The following flow describes the setup and operations of this solution in an overall cloud service management space:

1.	BlueCompute application components & infrastructure are monitored by 3rd party solution NewRelic for resource monitoring and URL response <and IBM BAM for synthetic monitoring (via ANS)>.

2.	The probes normalize the events into a common format and send them to the central Omnibus system. The monitoring events sent to NOI via these probes are then correlated, de-duplicated, analyzed & enriched. Further action may be automated or performed by an first responder/incident Owner/runbook automated service. 

3.	Impact has two roles. It extracts events from the BlueMix infrastructure and forwards events on to the collaboration and notification solutions. The analytics component of NOI enriches the events and finds correlations between events, limiting the number of alarms forwarded and making sure that important issues are prioritized. The dashboards are used both to display events and manually forward them if an operator decides to do so. Impact also enriches technical events with organizational and environmental context information like deployment location, service relationships or affected client. Here a MySQL configuration data source is leveraged.

4.	The correlated events are forwarded to collaboration and notification tools. Action may be performed to solve the issues detected. NOI supports a variety of such solutions and in this document we will look at integration with Slack for collaboration and IBM Alert Notification System Duty for notification and escalation. NOI can publish events to generic targets (i.e. a single Slack channel which is used for all alerts) or specific ones (i.e. NOI will be automated to create a dedicated Slack channel for a single generated event ). 

5. Runbooks connected to NOI are automated to update the event status based on the resolution of the issue. The status updates can also be manually handled within NOI. It also has capability to have bi-directional communication with notification tool so that event status update can take place in either tool. This updated status is then propagated.


#### System Context Flow for Grafana

<![System Context Flow Grafana](static/imgs/???.png?raw=true)>

The above figure shows the deep dive of Grafana and its various components and various integrated tools for incident management and their interactions. 

1.	A Perl Runtime collects on a regular scheduled basis data from various data sources which provide monitoring and status information for the BlueCompute application. In this scenario this includes the ressource monitoring data from NewRelic via a Rest API, the Bluemix Cloud Foundry information for applications and containers via the CF API and the NOI status information via the Netcool Rest API <and the synthetic monitoring results from BAM via a Rest API>.

2.	Perl runtime also accesses a configuration data source on MySQL to read and enrich the monitoring data with environment context data like deployment location and service-relationships.

3.	The perl runtime mashes up all relevant data and writes the consolidated data into the InfluxDB.

4.	Grafana accesses the data via its defined data sources and displays the InfluxDB data inside the configured dashboard pages.

5.	Grafana allows the launch of the event viewer page from NOI displaying events in context of a page item<as well as the launch og LogMet logfile search page in context of a page item>.

The following sections only focusses on updates needed to instrument or use a hybrid application and will defer to the published how-to documents for the selected tools of the toolchain.

###Step 3: Monitoring

####Step 3a: How to Use New Relic for BlueCompute

New Relic is a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) offering, where agents are injected into Bluemix Runtimes,  IBM Bluemix Containers or SoftLayer Containers and automatically start reporting metrics back to the New Relic service over the internet.

Please be aware that the instrumented components will need an active internet out-bound connection either directly or via various Gateway services.
